What is the battery life of the Razer Blade 18?
Our QHD+ and 4K laptops have a battery life of over 5 hours. When watching videos in airplane mode, our new Synapse software allows you to automatically optimize the screen resolution to FHD when running on battery.

Can I upgrade my RAM/SSD of the Razer Blade 18?
Yes, the Razer Blade 18 gaming laptop has two upgradeable DDR5 memory slots and M.2 storage slots that can support up to 96 GB RAM (5200 MHz) and 8 TB SSD. The M.2 slots support dual sided SSDs for maximum storage.

How much does the Razer Blade 18 weigh?
The new Razer Blade 18 weighs just 6.8 lbs (3.1 kg), compared to the Razer Blade 17 which weighs 6.05 lbs (2.75 kg).

How many USB ports are there on the Razer Blade 18?
The new Razer Blade 18 has three USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type A ports, one Thunderbolt 5 Port, one USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type C port, an RJ45 ethernet port, HDMI 2.1, a UHS-II SD card reader, a 3.5mm combo audio jack and a Kensington lock slot.

Note: GeForce RTX 4070 Configurations only support Thunderbolt 4

What makes the Razer Blade 18 different from the rest of the Blade family?
Designed to be the ultimate desktop replacement, the Razer Blade 18 has the most powerful components, the largest screen, and provides the most functionality out of our entire range.

What is the Maximum Graphics Power or TGP of the GeForce RTX 4060/4070 Laptop GPUs in the 2024 Razer Blade 18 gaming laptops?
With up to 115 W of base GPU Subsystem Power and up to 25 W additional with NVIDIA Dynamic Boost, our GeForce RTX 4060/4070 Laptop GPUs provide up to 140 W of TGP.

The Maximum Graphics Power is the highest GPU subsystem power supported in any mode, including Dynamic Boost 2.0 power transfer. Real world performance may vary depending on the application, thermal environment, and other factors. Testing was conducted in the Razer lab under max power settings in Razer Synapse and with FurMark. Furthermore, Razer has optimized thermal performance through our patented vapor chamber cooling system that comes standard on all 2024 Razer Blade laptops. Maximum Graphics Power details can also be found in the NVIDIA Control Panel under the System Information section of the application.

Is Maximum Graphics Power required to reach full performance of the GPU?
Generally, these GPUs do not need the maximum power to reach their maximum performance & frequency. This allows for a reduction in overall power levels to increase efficiency without sacrificing performance.

Under both simulated (e.g. 3DMark) and gaming workloads, NVIDIA GPU Boost algorithms will increase clocks until they hit a limit. On previous-generation GeForce RTX 30 Series Ampere architecture GPUs, that limit was typically the power limit. Since the GeForce RTX 4060/4070 require less power overall than previous generations, other limits (e.g., frequency, voltage, temperature, and others) may be hit prior to reaching peak power draw.

What kind of warranty does the Razer Blade 18 come with?
All Razer Blades come with a standard 1-year limited warranty on the laptop itself and an industry-leading 2-year warranty on the battery.
