How Do You Show Respect for the Planet?

The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 12 (14ʺ Intel) laptop still uses carbon fiber for the chassis — but better yet some of that carbon fiber is recycled from post-industrial remnants and is used along with 90% recycled magnesium. Plus, the chassis, the battery pack, the speaker enclosure, and the power adapter all include recycled post-consumer content. And we don’t stop there. The packaging is 100% plastic-free and comprised in part with rapid-renewable materials made from bamboo-sugar-cane fiber.

You Spoke. We Listened: We’ve Redesigned Our Legendary Keyboard

Our redesigned ThinkPad keyboard now includes tactile markings to help people with visual impairments more easily find the correct keys. We’ve moved the fingerprint reader to the keyboard, resulting in a larger sensor for a better experience. Plus, our TrackPad is even larger now, at 120mm / 4.72ʺ. Our beloved red TrackPoint still lets you navigate —  but with a double tap, it opens the ThinkPad TrackPoint Quick Menu to optimize audio-visuals, set alerts against muting, and even take notes with the Dictation Toolbar for handy speech-to-text transcription.
